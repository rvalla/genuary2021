# genuary 2021

Here I share some of the work I did to be part of [genuary 2021](htps://genuary2021.github.io). It is not all
here because I used tools from other bigger (or not so bigger) projects. I will share here other some other
related tools since February 2021.  

## some good results

### Tribute to Mondrian

A little collaborative homage to the famous dutch painter [Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian).
A game was used to collect a set of *Mondrian's strips* which were blended in a canvas using *Interferative* tool from
[pixelative](https://gitlab.com/azarte/pixelative). These work was inspired by January 9th prompt:
*Interference patterns*. You can see the results or make your own strips
[here](https://azarte.gitlab.io/eng/metamondrian.html).

### Dice lines

The prompt for January 7th was: *generate some rules, then follow them by hand on paper*. I proposed this algorithm:

-2 Take a sheet of paper and a pencil.  
-1 Draw a point in the middle.  
0 Roll two dice.  
1 The one closest to the sheet decides the direction.  
2 The other the length of the line.  
3 Go back to 0 until you get off the sheet.  

You can follow the rules by hand or use the [computer](https://azarte.gitlab.io/scripts/dicelines.html).
